# Writing Effective User Stories

The phrase "As a (blank), I want (blank) so that (blank)" is a template commonly used in Agile and user-centered design methodologies, particularly in the context of writing user stories. It's a structured way to express a user's needs and requirements for a particular feature or functionality of a product or system.

Here's a breakdown of the template:

- **As a (blank)**: In this part, you specify the user or role who is making the request. This helps identify who the feature is intended for and provides context for the requirement.
- **I want (blank)**: In this part, you describe the specific feature or functionality that the user is requesting. This is the action or capability that the user is seeking from the system or product.
- **So that (blank)**: In this part, you explain the underlying goal or benefit that the user expects to achieve by having the requested feature. It provides the rationale or motivation behind the user's request.

By using this template, teams can clearly define user needs, understand the purpose of a feature, and prioritize development based on user value and impact. It also helps ensure that the development team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what is being requested and why.

## User Story

As a pedestrian, I want the signal light to indicate when it's safe to cross the street so that I can cross the street without the risk of oncoming traffic.

This user story follows the format: "As a (user role), I want (a certain feature) so that (a specific benefit or reason)." In this case, it's written from the perspective of a pedestrian who wants the signal light to provide a safe crossing opportunity.

## Acceptance Criteria

 Here are some acceptance criteria for the user story "As a pedestrian, I want the signal light to indicate when it's safe to cross the street so that I can cross the street without the risk of oncoming traffic":

- The signal light must have clear and easily distinguishable indications for "Walk" and "Don't Walk."
- When the signal light displays "Walk," it should be safe for pedestrians to start crossing the street.
- When the signal light displays "Don't Walk," pedestrians should not attempt to cross the street, as it is not safe to do so.
- The signal light should provide a countdown timer when displaying "Don't Walk," indicating the time remaining before it changes to "Walk."
- The timing of the signal light should allow pedestrians adequate time to cross the street safely.
- The signal light should be positioned at a height and location that is easily visible to pedestrians waiting to cross.
- The signal light should be properly maintained to ensure it functions correctly and does not display misleading information.
- In case of any malfunctions or damage to the signal light, there should be a mechanism in place to report and repair it promptly.

These **acceptance criteria** ensure that the signal light effectively serves the pedestrian's need for safe and efficient street crossing. They also cover aspects such as visibility, timing, and maintenance to ensure the signal light's reliability.
